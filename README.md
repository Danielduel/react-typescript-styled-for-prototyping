Want a quick and dirty way to start a project? This repository might grab your attention.

Based on output of

`yarn create react-app react-typescript-styled-for-prototyping --template typescript`

Removed:
- Tests -> most likely you will pick something else
- Default styles
- WebVitals reporter

Added:
- style for body in `public/index.html`
- styled-components and types for it

Changed:
- default imports are using doublequotes - my personal preference
- removed autoopening project on start (see .env file)
